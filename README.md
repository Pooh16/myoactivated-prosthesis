# myoactivated-prosthesis
Designed and developed a functional 3D-printed prosthetic arm that is capable of being controlled through sEMG signals to enable natural and intuitive movement.
The current status of this project is it works acquiring emg signals and actuating the 3D printed prosthetic arm. It is signal processed and actuated according to the set threshold. The machine learning model is being developed using SVM.
